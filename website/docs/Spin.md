A spinner for displaying loading state of a page or a section.

## When To Use

When part of the page is waiting for asynchronous data or during a rendering process, an appropriate loading animation can effectively alleviate users' inquietude.

## Examples

```js
import { Spin } from 'tailor-ui';
```

### default usage

```jsx live
<div style={{ height: '300px' }}>
  <Spin />
</div>
```
