# Switch

Switching Selector.

## When To Use

- If you need to represent the switching between two states or on-off state.
- The difference between Switch and Checkbox is that Switch will trigger a state change directly when you toggle it, while Checkbox is generally used for state marking, which should work in conjunction with submit operation.

## Examples

```js
import { Switch } from 'tailor-ui';
```

### With controlled

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [checked, setChecked] = React.useState(true);

    return (
      <>
        <Switch checked onChange={console.log} />
        <br />
        <Switch checked={checked} onChange={() => setChecked(!checked)} />
      </>
    );

}}

</Playground>

### With uncontrolled

<Playground>
  <Switch defaultChecked onChange={console.log} />
</Playground>

### With disabled

<Playground>
  <Switch defaultChecked disabled />
  <br />
  <Switch defaultChecked={false} disabled />
</Playground>
